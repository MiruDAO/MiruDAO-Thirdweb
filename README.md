# MiruDAO - Democratizing neurotech IP 

### **Welcome ðŸ‘‹**
This repo is our proof of concept dapp (decentralized application) for submitting and voting on proposals using thirdweb. We will likely migrate to another repo in the near future using a different technical architecture.
## About MiruDAO
MiruDAO is a new community-governed, decentralized market for neurotech IP. Weâ€™re here to accelerate exploration of how the brain works.
